    <h1>MY JOURNEY AS A WEB DEVELOPER</h1>
        <p>
            I recently got introduced to the wonderful world of web development and I am still trying to find my way around the myriad of stuff<br> but I think this is a perfect place to start and to showcase my development as time goes on.

        </p>
    <h2>my projects so far</h2>
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li>photography-website</li>
                    <li>my portfolio-website</li>




                </ul>
 </nav>
 <div class="explanations";id='photography-website'>
        <h3>about photography-website
        </h3>
            <p>
                It was primarily an independent project that was handen to us as an assignment<br>
                but to meet it ignited a flame for web development as I have never seen inside me before<br>
                the process of coding step by step as I slowly watched my webpage came to life gave a satisfaction that could not be found anywhere<br>
                so without further ado:
            </p>
            <h3>a glimpse</h3>
            <p>here is a gist of what my photography website actually kinda looks like<br>
                below is the blue print behind the making of the webpage<br>
                my design<br>
